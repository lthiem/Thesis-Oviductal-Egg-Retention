Energetics of Reproduction in *Sternotherus odoratus**


**Abstract**

Turtles are thought to have no parental care after oviposition, and instead females primarily invest energy into the formation of eggs prior to oviposition. Individuals allocate their reproductive resources to increasing body lipids, vitellogenesis, developing the embryo, and egg retention (retaining eggs within the oviduct while development is temporally halted). Egg retention in turtles presents a potential tradeoff. Retaining eggs for an extended period after fertilization benefits turtles in allowing flexibility in timing of reproduction and in nest site selection. At the population level, egg retention can lead to synchronized hatching among nests, which increases survival rates of offspring due to predator dilution. Conversely, female’s risk becoming egg bound if eggs are retained too long. Additionally, prolonged egg retention may become energetically expensive for the female. This seems unlikely due to many species retaining their eggs for prolonged periods of time. Our objective in this study was to test the energetic costs of egg retention in Eastern Musk Turtles (Sternotherus odoratus) to determine the potential energetic tradeoff associated with limited parental care. We measured the metabolic rates of gravid and non-gravid females throughout their reproductive cycle using open flow respirometry. Metabolic rates were significantly higher in gravid females than either males or non-gravid females (p-value= 0.022 and p-value=0.001). On average gravid females metabolic rates were about 103 (J/hr). Male’s metabolic rates on average were about 92.6(J/hr) and non-gravid females had about 83.6(J/hr) metabolic rate. Energy investment for gravid females was positively correlated with whole clutch mass and whole clutch metabolic rate. The metabolic rate for gravid females was about 20 percent higher than their non-gravid metabolic rates.  These findings support the hypothesis that egg retention is not an energetically expensive strategy compared to other parts of reproduction for musk turtles.
